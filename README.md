# Smart Resource Prioritizer (SRP)

## Overview

The **Smart Resource Prioritizer (SRP)** is a machine learning-based tool designed to help decision-makers allocate limited resources during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises. By analyzing various factors (e.g., population, severity, infrastructure damage), SRP predicts optimal resource distribution.

## Features

- **Data Generation**: Generates sample crisis data for 50 locations.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts the best resource allocation using a decision tree model.
- **Prioritization**: Identifies top-priority locations needing assistance.
- **Feature Analysis**: Visualizes the importance of various factors in resource allocation.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Can predict resource allocation for new crisis locations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SharanyaVermaRaj/smart-resource-prioritizer.git
